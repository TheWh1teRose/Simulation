# NAO Sim2Real Gap

This project investigates the reality gap between simulated and real NAO robots by comparing movement trajectories and evaluating the sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal is to evaluate how accurately physics simulations can replicate real-world robot behaviors. This research focuses on:
- Implementing a NAO robot model in simulation
- Comparing movement trajectories between simulated and real robots
- Quantifying the reality gap
- Documenting methodologies for effective sim-to-real transfer

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Simulation Environment
We initially planned to use MuJoCo but switched to PyBullet due to better NAO model compatibility. The simulation setup includes:
- PyBullet physics engine
- NAO robot model with fixed torso
- Position control for stable joints
- Velocity control for movement execution

### Real Robot Setup
The real-world measurements are captured using:
- AprilTag markers on the NAO robot
- Camera tracking system
- Joint trajectory recording

### Analysis Approach
The comparison between simulation and reality will be conducted by:
- Recording single joint movements
- Measuring trajectories in both environments
- Computing euclidean distances from target positions
- Analyzing movement accuracy and patterns

## üìä Current Project State
